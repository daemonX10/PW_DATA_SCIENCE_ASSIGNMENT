    "#### What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples in programming have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered**: Tuples maintain the order of elements, i.e., the order in which elements are added to a tuple is the order in which they are accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its value, i.e., you cannot add, modify, or delete elements from the tuple. This immutability makes tuples reliable for fixed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Allow Duplicates**: Tuples allow duplicate values, i.e., you can have a tuple with elements that have the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indexable**: Elements in a tuple can be accessed using their index.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterable**: You can loop over the elements of a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Can Contain Multiple Data Types**: A tuple can contain elements of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, a tuple is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Creating a tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples are ordered\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: apple\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples are immutable, this will raise an error\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = \"avocado\"  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples allow duplicates\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\")\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples are indexable\n",
    "print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: cherry\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples are iterable\n",
    "for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",

    "\n",
    "Tuples in Python have only two built-in methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **count()**: This method returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)\n",
    "print(my_tuple.count(5))  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **index()**: This method finds the first occurrence of the specified value and returns its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)\n",
    "print(my_tuple.index(8))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why tuples have only two methods compared to lists is because tuples are immutable. Most of the list methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc., modify the list. Since tuples can't be modified after they're created, they don't have methods that modify them.\n",
