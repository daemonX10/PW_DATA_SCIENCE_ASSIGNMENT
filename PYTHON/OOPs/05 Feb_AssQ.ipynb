    "1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that are common to all objects of that class. Attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods are member functions of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e., an object is created) memory is allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:  # This is a class\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, brand):\n",
    "        self.color = color  # These are attributes\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display(self):  # This is a method\n",
    "        print(f\"This is a {self.color} {self.brand} car.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the Car class\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"red\", \"Toyota\")\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"blue\", \"Ford\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling a method using the objects\n",
    "car1.display()  # Output: This is a red Toyota car.\n",
    "car2.display()  # Output: This is a blue Ford car.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Car` is a class with attributes `color` and `brand`, and a method `display()`. `car1` and `car2` are objects (instances) of the `Car` class."

    "2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. It's a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**: This is a process in which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**: This allows methods to be used in the same way even though they may be behaving differently under the hood. Polymorphism promotes flexibility and interface reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: This is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.\n"

    "3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` function in Python is a special method, also known as a class constructor or initialization method, that is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to set up the new object with default data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name `__init__` is a special naming convention in Python for such methods. The double underscores before and after the name signify that it's a special method that the Python interpreter recognizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class defines an `__init__()` method, class instantiation automatically invokes `__init__()` for the newly-created class instance. For example, if we have a class `Car`, and `Car` has an `__init__()` method that accepts color and brand, when we create a new instance of the class, Python calls the `__init__()` method to initialize the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, brand):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the Car class\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"red\", \"Toyota\")\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"blue\", \"Ford\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(car1.color, car1.brand)  # Output: red Toyota\n",
    "print(car2.color, car2.brand)  # Output: blue Ford\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `__init__()` initializes `color` and `brand` to the values passed as arguments when the class is instantiated. `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods associated with that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the `__init__()` method, we would need to manually initialize each object after its creation. With this method, we ensure that the object is correctly initialized upon creation. This can help prevent bugs and make the code more readable and maintainable."

    "4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), particularly in Python, `self` is a convention for the first parameter of instance methods. An instance method is a method that operates on an instance (or object) of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods associated with that instance. This is necessary because when you're dealing with objects, you want to be able to specify which particular object you are interacting with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, brand):\n",
    "        self.color = color  # 'self' allows us to access the instance's attributes\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display(self):  # 'self' is the first parameter of instance methods\n",
    "        print(f\"This is a {self.color} {self.brand} car.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"red\", \"Toyota\")\n",
    "car1.display()  # Output: This is a red Toyota car.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `self` is used in the `__init__` and `display` methods to refer to the instance of the class. When we call `car1.display()`, `self` is automatically passed the instance `car1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term `self` is a convention, not a keyword. You could technically use any name you want, but it's strongly recommended to stick with `self` because it's universally recognized by other Python developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `self` allows us to differentiate between instance variables (belonging to an instance of the class) and class variables (belonging to the class itself), and also to access other instance methods if needed. It's a way to ensure that the method or attribute is associated with the current instance.\n"

    "5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a class (child or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or base class). It allows for code reusability, organization, and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: When a class inherits from a single base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def func2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "child.func1()  # Output: This is function 1\n",
    "child.func2()  # Output: This is function 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: When a class inherits from more than one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent1:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2:\n",
    "    def func2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "    def func3(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "child.func1()  # Output: This is function 1\n",
    "child.func2()  # Output: This is function 2\n",
    "child.func3()  # Output: This is function 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class GrandParent:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(GrandParent):\n",
    "    def func2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def func3(self):\n",

    "child.func2()  # Output: This is function 2\n",
    "child.func3()  # Output: This is function 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: When one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child1(Parent):\n",

    "\n",
    "class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "    def func3(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "child1 = Child1()\n",
    "child1.func1()  # Output: This is function 1\n",
    "child1.func2()  # Output: This is function 2\n",
    "\n",
    "child2 = Child2()\n",
    "child2.func1()  # Output: This is function 1\n",
    "child2.func3()  # Output: This is function 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class GrandParent:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent1(GrandParent):\n",

    "class Parent2(GrandParent):\n",
    "    def func3(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 3\")\n",
    "\n",

    "    def func4(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is function 4\")\n",

    "child.func2()  # Output: This is function 2\n",
    "child.func3()  # Output: This is function 3\n",
    "child.func4()  # Output: This is function 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, `func1`, `func2`, etc. are methods, and `Parent`, `Child`, etc. are classes. The child classes inherit methods from the parent classes."
