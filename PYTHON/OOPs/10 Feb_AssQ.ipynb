    "1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening. \n",
    "In Python, the `open()` function is used to open a file. It takes two parameters: the name of the file (including its path if not in the same directory), and the mode in which to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read mode. This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write mode. If the file exists, it truncates the file. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. The operation fails if the file exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append mode. It opens the file for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode. This mode is used for non-text files like images or executable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'t'`: Text mode. This is the default mode. It's used when working with text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'+'`: Update mode. It opens the file for updating (reading and writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "These modes can be combined. For example, `'rb'` opens the file in binary format for reading, while `'w+'` opens the file for both writing and reading."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file? \n",
    "\n",
    "The `close()` function is used in Python to close a file after you're done working with it. It's important to close a file for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**: Every open file consumes system resources, which are limited. If you're working with many files and you don't close them, you might run out of resources, causing your program to crash or run inefficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Loss Prevention**: When you write to a file, the data is often buffered and doesn't get written to the disk immediately. If your program crashes or finishes execution before the data is written to the disk, you might lose data. Closing a file ensures that the buffer is flushed and all your data gets written to the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Corruption Prevention**: If a file is open in write mode in your program and another program tries to open it, it can lead to file corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concurrency Issues**: Closing files when you're done with them can help prevent concurrency issues in multi-threaded applications where multiple threads might be trying to read from or write to the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Good Programming Practice**: It's considered good programming practice to clean up resources after you're done using them. This includes closing files after you're done working with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the `with` statement to automatically close a file after you're done working with it. This ensures that the file is properly closed even if an error occurs while working with the file. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "# At this point, f is automatically closed, so you don't need to call f.close()\n",

    "Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.   \n",
    "Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Create a text file and write to it\n",
    "with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as f:\n",

    "The file is then opened again with the 'r' mode to read its contents. The `read()` method is used to read the entire contents of the file, which is then printed to the console. The `with` statement is used to automatically close the file after the operations are done."

    "Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines(). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()` are methods used to read data from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `read()`: This method reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "\n",

    "    content = f.read()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `readline()`: This method reads the next line of the file. Each time it's called, it returns the next line of the file. If it's called when the end of the file has been reached, it returns an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    line = f.readline()\n",
    "    while line:\n",
    "        print(line, end='')  # end='' is used to prevent adding extra newline because readline() retains the newline from the file\n",
    "        line = f.readline()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `readlines()`: This method reads all the lines of the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string is one line.\n",
    "\n",

    "with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    lines = f.readlines()\n",

    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together? \n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement in Python is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working with files using the `open()` function, it's very important to close the file after you're done with it. Failing to do this can lead to data loss or corruption. However, ensuring that files are properly closed can be cumbersome, especially if the file operations are complex and involve many paths of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `with` statement comes in. It ensures that the file is properly closed when the block inside `with` is exited. This means you don't have to explicitly call the `close()` method on the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "# At this point, f is automatically closed, so you don't need to call f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `with` statement automatically takes care of closing the file once the operations within its block are completed, even if an error occurs within the block. This makes the code cleaner and less prone to errors."

    "Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `write()` and `writelines()` are methods used to write data to a file.\n",

    "1. `write()`: This method writes a string to the file. If the file was opened in text mode (which is the default), the string must contain only text.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. `writelines()`: This method writes a list of strings to the file. If the file was opened in text mode, all strings in the list must contain only text. Unlike `write()`, `writelines()` does not add any separators between the list elements, so if you want each string on a new line, you must add the newline characters yourself.\n",
    "\n",

    "with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    lines = ['Hello, world!\\n', 'How are you today?\\n']\n",
