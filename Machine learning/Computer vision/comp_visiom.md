This mostly contains the code for the computer vision projects I have done.

I will Update the link of the github repository soon. [liveLinks]:

## [Face Detection]

## [Face Recognition]
This is a face recognition project that I have done using the face_recognition library in python. It is a simple project that can be used to recognize faces in a video or in a live stream. The code is in the file face_recognition.py. The code is well commented and easy to understand. The code is also available in my github repository. The link is given below.

## [Handwritten Digit Recognition]

This is a handwritten digit recognition project that I have done using the mnist dataset. It is a simple project that can be used to recognize handwritten digits. The code is in the file handwritten_digit_recognition.py. The code is well commented and easy to understand. The code is also available in my github repository. The link is given below.

## [Object Detection]

This is an object detection project that I have done using the yolov3 model. It is a simple project that can be used to detect objects in a video or in a live stream. The code is in the file object_detection.py. The code is well commented and easy to understand. The code is also available in my github repository. The link is given below.

## [Object Tracking]

This is an object tracking project that I have done using the yolov3 model. It is a simple project that can be used to track objects in a video or in a live stream. The code is in the file object_tracking.py. The code is well commented and easy to understand. The code is also available in my github repository. The link is given below.

## [Optical Character Recognition]

This is an optical character recognition project that I have done using the pytesseract library. It is a simple project that can be used to recognize text in a video or in a live stream. The code is in the file optical_character_recognition.py. The code is well commented and easy to understand. The code is also available in my github repository. The link is given below.

## [Real Time Face Recognition]

This is a real time face recognition project that I have done using the face_recognition library in python. It is a simple project that can be used to recognize faces in a live stream.
